# Bookmarklet to import meetings from Slush Matchmaking to calendar

This bookmarket allows users to export their meetings from Slush Matchmaking into an `.ics` file, which makes it easy to then import those meetings to their own calendar.

Install it from: [https://laurihy.github.io/slush-matchmaking-export/](https://laurihy.github.io/slush-matchmaking-export/)

## About the Implementation

Since Slush Matchmaking doesn't provide an API, the bookmarklet uses Javascript to parse elements directly from rendered HTML. This means, that simple UI changes to the matchmaking platform might break this bookmarklet. Too bad `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
